# Pixel Art Maker (Udacity Project)

## Purpose

This project is my solution to an assignment in udacity's program "Intro to programming". 

The goal was to use DOM interaction features in javascript, to make a canvas, which fields can be colored by clicks from the user. Canvas size and color can be set by the user.
